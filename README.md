- Loops and control statements

### [Part 2: Arrays, Strings and Functions](Part2.md)

- Working with arrays (1D, 2D)
- String manipulation
- Creating and using methods
- Combining arrays and strings
- Practical array operations

### [Part 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](Part3.md)

- Classes and objects
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Interfaces and abstract classes

### [Part 4: Exception Handling, File I/O and Collections](Part4.md)

- Exception handling mechanisms
- Reading and writing text files
- Collections Framework overview
- Working with Lists, Sets and Maps
- Combining file operations with collections

### [Part 5: Streams, Multithreading and JDBC](Part5.md)

- Java I/O Streams
- Multithreading basics
- Concurrency programming
- Database connectivity with JDBC
- CRUD operations with databases

## 🎯 Final Project

The [final project](FINAL.md) is a comprehensive Library Management System that integrates all the concepts learned throughout the course:

- Object-oriented design with inheritance hierarchy
- Database connectivity for data persistence
- Multithreaded operations for background tasks
- File I/O for data backup
- Exception handling for robust application behavior

## 🧩 Learning Approach

Each part contains:

1. Theoretical lessons
2. Practical examples
3. A mini-project at the end of each section to apply the knowledge

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with [Part 1](Part1.md) and follow the course in order
2. Complete each mini-project before moving to the next part
3. Apply the concepts learned in previous sections to new material
4. Build the final project as a capstone to demonstrate your skills

## 📌 Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge
- JDK 8 or higher installed
- Any IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions)
- Database setup (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) for Part 5
