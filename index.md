- **[Vue.js](/VUE/Part1)** - Easy to learn, flexible progressive framework

### Important Note

::: warning Not necessary to learn everything
You **do not need** to learn all materials. Focus on the main roadmap (Module 1-8) first, then choose a specialization that fits your career goals.
:::

**Estimated time:** 6-9 months (full-time study) or 12-18 months (part-time study)

## 💡 Advice For Learners

### 🎯 Effective learning principles

::: tip Learn in order
Follow the suggested roadmap. Each module builds on the knowledge from previous modules. Skipping basic steps will cause difficulties later.
:::

::: tip Practice is the key
Spend at least **70% of time** writing actual code. Reading materials only takes **30%**. There are no shortcuts in programming - only consistent practice.
:::

::: tip Do projects
After each module, build a small project combining what you've learned. This is the best way to consolidate and apply knowledge.
:::

::: tip Don't chase new technologies
Focus on **fundamentals** first. Once you master the basics, learning new technologies will be much easier.
:::

### 📚 Learning method

1. **Read and understand theory** - Spend 20-30 minutes
2. **Practice immediately** - Code along with examples
3. **Experiment and adjust** - Change code, see what happens
4. **Do exercises** - Apply newly learned knowledge
5. **Build small projects** - Combine multiple concepts

### 🔄 When facing difficulties

1. **Re-read materials** - Sometimes you miss important details
2. **Search on Google** - Use the search skills you've learned
3. **Check code again** - Debug step by step
4. **Ask the community** - Stack Overflow, Reddit, Discord
5. **Rest and come back** - Sometimes the brain needs time to process information

### ⏱️ Time management

- **Full-time study:** 6-8 hours/day, 5-6 days/week
- **Part-time study:** 2-3 hours/day, may extend study duration

::: warning Quality over quantity
2 hours of absolute focus is better than 5 hours of distracted study. Turn off notifications, find a quiet place and focus 100%.
:::
