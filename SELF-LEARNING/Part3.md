   - Auditory (learning through listening)
   - Reading/Writing (learning through reading and writing)
   - Kinesthetic (learning through practice)
   - Combine multiple styles for optimization

### Effective Learning Techniques

1. **Spaced Repetition**

   - Working principle: Repeat knowledge in increasing intervals
   - Tools: Anki, Quizlet, RemNote
   - Application in programming: Review syntax, design patterns, algorithms

2. **Active Recall**

   - Self-test knowledge instead of re-reading
   - Create flashcards with questions and concepts
   - Explain concepts in your own words
   - Practice coding challenges without looking at documentation

3. **Chunking**

   - Break complex knowledge into manageable pieces
   - Connect "chunks" into knowledge network
   - Example: Learn framework by dividing into modules

4. **Feynman Technique**
   - Step 1: Choose concept to learn
   - Step 2: Explain as if teaching a beginner
   - Step 3: Identify gaps and go back to study
   - Step 4: Simplify and use examples

### Managing Learning Resources

1. **Selecting learning resources**

   - Evaluate quality of learning sources
   - Combine multiple types of materials: books, courses, videos, blogs
   - Avoid jumping from course to course (tutorial hell)

2. **Creating personal learning system**

   - Organize learning materials by topic
   - Store code snippets for reuse
   - Summarize notes from multiple sources

3. **Leveraging technology for learning support**
   - Knowledge management apps: Notion, Obsidian
   - Programming learning tools: freeCodeCamp, LeetCode, HackerRank
   - IDE extensions: support learning and practicing code

## 🧑‍🏫 Lesson 3: Building and Executing Learning Roadmap

### Analyzing Learning Needs and Goals

1. **Setting clear learning goals**

   - Long-term goals (5 years): Become backend expert, AI developer, etc.
   - Medium-term goals (1 year): Master a framework, proficient in a language
   - Short-term goals (1-3 months): Complete a course, build a project

2. **Assessing current skills**

   - Self-assess according to skill matrix
   - Seek feedback from colleagues, mentors
   - Take proficiency tests

3. **Skill Gap Analysis**
   - Compare current skills with target requirements
   - Prioritize core and necessary skills
   - Identify prerequisite knowledge to learn first

### Designing Learning Roadmap

1. **Effective roadmap structure**

   - From fundamentals to advanced
   - Combine theory and practice
   - Ensure continuous knowledge application

2. **Defining milestones**

   - Divide roadmap into clear stages
   - Set measurable objectives
   - Create "quick wins" to maintain motivation

3. **Creating learning plan**
